# SpaceBandits: Contextual Bandits for the Future

It's 2018 and AI is everywhere. Isn't it time for a package that makes Deep Bayesian Contextual Bandits models simple to deploy?<br><br>

SpaceBandits takes the advanced models developed and experimented on in the Google Brain research paper [Deep Bayesian Bandits Showdown: An Empirical Comparison of Bayesian Deep Networks for Thompson Sampling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09127.pdf) and makes them easy to build and manage.

## Usage

This package is currently under development. To install the latest release, use pip: 

`
pip install space_bandits
`

For a introduction to using the library, check out the [demo notebook](demo.ipynb).
