# SpaceBandits: Contextual Bandits from the Future

It's 2018 and neural networks are everywhere. Isn't it time for a package that makes Deep Bayesian Contextual Bandits models simple to deploy?<br><br>

SpaceBandits takes the advanced models developed and experimented on in the 2018 Google Brain research paper [Deep Bayesian Bandits Showdown: An Empirical Comparison of Bayesian Deep Networks for Thompson Sampling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09127.pdf) and makes them easy to build, train, manage, and deploy.

## Usage

The alpha release of SpaceBandits, v0.0.9, is the current version. To install the latest release, use pip: 

`
pip install space_bandits
`

For a introduction to using the library and the online-learning API, check out the [demo notebook](demo.ipynb).<br><br>
A toy problem and offline-learning API walkthrough is available in the [toy problem notebook](toy_problem.ipynb)

## Development

SpaceBandits is currently in development. Please use it and report any issues you have so I can try to address them before the v0.1.0 release.<br><br>

Contributors are welcomed! New models from the [Google Brain paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09127.pdf) or others might find a home here as well.
