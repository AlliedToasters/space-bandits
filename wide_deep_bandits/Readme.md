## Wide and Deep Bandits

A modified version of space-bandits that adds a wide component that can take individual user IDs as inputs. Based on the paper Deep Bayesian Bandits: Exploring in Online Personalized Recommendations by Guo et al. (2020).The wide network will complement the deep neural network by remembering the individual user behaviors while the deep network makes generalizations based on the context features.
